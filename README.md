# Battleship-Atomic

This Game uses SDL2 and SDL2_Mixer library for C

This was my first project in the University!
Created in 2018 in the course "Programming I".

If i must redo this, surely the code would be much more beautiful.

Enjoy :)

Compile with the line:
<< gcc battleship.c -o battleship.exe -lSDL2 -lSDL_mixer >>
